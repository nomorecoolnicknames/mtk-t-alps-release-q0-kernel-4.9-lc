 * FORGE m681 (2026-08-16): QMU descriptor-walk guard.  §11.205.
 *
 * The 4.4 vendor drop replaced every BUG_ON() in this file with WARN_ON()
 * and left NO return path behind it, so each "this must never happen"
 * check warns and then executes exactly the statement it just complained
 * about.  In qmu_done_rx() that is fatal:
 *
 *   1. the walk flags !TGPD_GET_NEXT(gpd)                 (warn, continue)
 *   2. gpd = TGPD_GET_NEXT(gpd)                           => NULL
 *   3. gpd = gpd_phys_to_virt(NULL, USB_RX, ep)
 *        = rx_gpd_map[ep].p_desc - rx_gpd_map[ep].p_desc_dma
 *        = PAGE_OFFSET - PHYS_OFFSET  = 0xffffffbfc0000000 -- NON-NULL, so
 *          the vendor's `if (!gpd)` check below is structurally blind to it
 *   4. the next loop-top TGPD_IS_FLAGS_HWO(gpd) reads that address, which
 *      sits in the hole BELOW the 39-bit TTBR1 base => data abort with
 *      DFSC 0x04 (translation fault, LEVEL 0) and WnR 0 -- exactly the
 *      ESR 0x96000004 recovered from the ramoops ring.  A plain NULL would
 *      have faulted at level 1 on this VA_BITS=39/4K kernel, so the ESR
 *      itself discriminates: the faulting pointer is the translated one.
 *
 * With CONFIG_PANIC_ON_OOPS=y that Oops in softirq resets the die in ~2 s
 * and the phone lands in the preloader -- the "USB transfer kills the
 * phone" symptom.
 *
 * 2026-08-18, REVISION 2 (the giveback fix).  Shipping this guard with the
 * default flipped to 1 hung the phone at the end of the boot animation --
 * ramoops taken before any reboot showed NO Oops, NO panic and NO hung-task
 * over 647 s of uptime with a cleanly serviced power-key longpress, i.e.
 * the kernel was alive and USERSPACE was stuck.  The defect was in the
 * guard itself: a bare `return` out of the walk abandons the usb_request
 * that is already on musb_ep->req_list.  Nothing ever gives it back, its
 * status stays -EINPROGRESS, functionfs never completes the read/write and
 * the consumer waits forever.  Worse, the bare return also leaves
 * Rx_gpd_last[] pointing at the damaged descriptor, so the very next QMU
 * interrupt re-enters the same branch: the endpoint is wedged for good.
 *
 * Every guarded exit now completes the pending request with -EPROTO first,
 * using the musb_g_giveback() that this same walk already calls mid-loop
 * (it is annotated __releases/__acquires ep->musb->lock and qmu_done_tasklet
 * is the context it was written for).  f_fs.c does not interpret the value:
 * ffs_epfile_io_complete() stores req->status verbatim and the io paths
 * return it straight to userspace, so the load-bearing part is that the
 * request completes AT ALL.  -EPROTO rather than -EIO only so that the
 * failure is distinguishable from f_fs's own queue-failure -EIO.
 *
 * 2026-08-21, REVISION 4: the default is 1 (ARMED AT BOOT).  This half was
 * exercised on the handset on 2026-08-20 with the r3 image: the 640 KB OUT
 * transfer still failed and RXD-NOREQ fired repeatedly, but the phone stayed
 * on the bus as 2a45:201c, uptime kept climbing 14 -> 145, dmesg for that
 * boot carried ZERO Internal error / Oops, and adb came back by itself after
 * ~20 s.  Before the guard the same failure killed the kernel within one or
 * two transfers.  Disarm at runtime or from the command line if a boot
 * regresses:
 *   echo 0 > /sys/module/musb_hdrc/parameters/forge_qmu_guard
 * or musb_hdrc.forge_qmu_guard=0 on the kernel command line.
 *
 * 2026-08-18, REVISION 3 (the knob split).  Up to r2 this ONE knob armed two
 * logically independent changes at once:
 *
 *   (a) this file's GPD-walk guard -- early exit + giveback, the branches
 *       tagged RXD- and TXD- below;
 *   (b) scheduling musb->error_recovery (flush + re-arm of every queued GPD)
 *       for RXQ_ZLPERR and RXQ_EMPTY, which stock clears and ignores.
 *
 * (b) is not a NULL-deref fix at all: it makes the driver flush and re-arm
 * the endpoint on latches that fire in normal operation, which is its own
 * candidate for a userspace stall.  With both behind one knob, a boot that
 * hangs cannot say which half did it -- and on this device a boot test costs
 * the owner several manual actions.  So (b) now lives behind
 * forge_qmu_recover, and dmesg tags the two halves apart: the walk branches
 * print guard=%d, the recovery branches print recover=%d.
 *
 * Every guarded site prints an unconditional, ratelimited pr_notice BEFORE
 * deciding, so the disarmed leg still names the branch that fired in the
 * crash dump.  pr_notice is used rather than qmu_printk() because the
 * latter is masked off by musb_core.c's default debug_level.

/*
 * FORGE m681: the OTHER half, split out of forge_qmu_guard on 2026-08-18.
 * Arms nothing in the walk; it only lets RXQ_ZLPERR / RXQ_EMPTY schedule the
 * existing error_recovery tasklet (flush + re-arm) instead of being latched
 * and dropped the way stock does.
 *
 * 2026-08-21, REVISION 4.  This is now BOUNDED and its two latches are NOT
 * equal, because the recovery body is far more violent than "flush + re-arm"
 * suggests.  qmu_error_recovery() runs under spin_lock_irqsave(&musb->lock),
 * and for the endpoint it decodes it calls _ex_mu3d_hal_flush_qmu(), which:
 *
 *   1. mu3d_hal_stop_qmu() -- if the queue is ACTIVE it writes QMU_Q_STOP and
 *      then wait_for_value(RQCSR, QMU_Q_ACTIVE, 0, 10, 100).  ms_intvl is 10
 *      and count is 100, and wait_for_value() uses mdelay(), so an
 *      unstoppable queue busy-waits up to ONE FULL SECOND with interrupts
 *      disabled, and then takes a WARN_ON(1) backtrace on top;
 *   2. free_gpd() -- os_memset() of the WHOLE GPD ring for that endpoint,
 *      which zeroes any descriptor the host is mid-transfer into;
 *   3. Rx_gpd_end/Rx_gpd_last reset to head and RQSAR rewritten;
 *   4. every request still on req_list re-inserted from offset 0 -- and on
 *      the RX leg request->actual is NOT reset first, unlike the TX leg.
 *
 * That is an acceptable price for RXQ_ZLPERR, which is a genuine error latch
 * and did not fire once in the 2026-08-20 capture.  It is NOT acceptable
 * unbounded for RXQ_EMPTY: RX-queue-empty is reached whenever the host sends
 * while no GPD is armed, i.e. in the gap between two f_fs reads, and the
 * 2026-08-20 dmesg shows it repeating many times per second.  Recovering on
 * every one of those would memset the ring under a live adb stream, and --
 * at the RXD-NOREQ moment req_list is empty by definition -- would re-arm
 * NOTHING, so the very next host packet raises RXQ_EMPTY again: a
 * self-sustaining flush loop, each iteration a candidate for the 1 s
 * interrupts-off spin above.  The 2026-08-20 run also proves the condition
 * SELF-HEALS (adb returned unaided after ~20 s), so an unbounded flush loop
 * would be trading a recoverable stall for an unrecoverable one.
 *
 * So: forge_qmu_recover defaults to 1 and that arms RXQ_ZLPERR only.  Value
 * 2 additionally arms RXQ_EMPTY and is deliberately NOT the default -- set it
 * at runtime if the ZLPERR-only build shows the ring needs the harder reset.
 * Both latches spend from forge_qmu_recover_budget, so no value of this knob
 * can produce an unbounded recovery storm.

 * never clears.  Runtime arming is not usable here -- the transport dies

 * measurement -- §11.219 spent its whole 100000 budget without fixing a single
 * transfer, and §11.224 reproduced the failure bit-for-bit with it switched
 * off.  Keeping it armed costs something real: RX-EMPTY is the NORMAL
 * end-of-queue condition here, so it storms, and its logging alone rotates the
 * kernel ring within ~39 s of boot.  That is how §11.233's flashlight verdict
 * became unreadable -- an early-boot pr_err that no longer survives to when
 * adb comes up.  A refuted mechanism should not also be blinding the log.

/* FORGE m681 (2026-08-24): rescue for the STALLED receive queue, §11.226.
 *
 * §11.224 measured the end state of the failure three times with the
 * on-demand dump, and it is the same every time: ep1 RQCSR=0 (the queue is
 * NOT active), hwo=0 (not one descriptor armed), Rx_gpd_last == Rx_gpd_end
 * == RQCPR (the driver believes it has reaped everything), and epstat
 * gap = 19..20 -- that many OUT requests queued and never given back.  adbd
 * blocks on those forever, so every later transfer fails too, including
 * adb shell; only `adb reconnect`, which re-enables the endpoint, heals it.
 *
 * Two facts decide the shape of this code:
 *
 *  - Re-running the reaping walk cannot help.  qmu_done_rx() returns at once
 *    when gpd == gpd_current, and that IS the measured state.  There is
 *    nothing left to reap: hardware consumed all 48 descriptors while only
 *    29..34 done-interrupts arrived, so the completions were lost, not late.
 *
 *  - The requests have to be re-armed, which is exactly what the vendor's
 *    qmu_error_recovery() body already does (flush, then walk req_list and
 *    insert a fresh GPD per queued request).  What was wrong with it was the
 *    TRIGGER, not the remedy: it fires on RXQ_ZLPERR / RX-EMPTY, and RX-EMPTY
 *    is the NORMAL end-of-queue condition here, so it stormed and spent its
 *    whole 100000 budget during boot (§11.219).  With forge_qmu_recover=0 the
 *    failure is identical (§11.224), so that path neither causes nor cures it.
 *
 * Same remedy, honest trigger.  This poll looks for the one state that cannot
 * occur in healthy operation -- requests outstanding AND the queue inactive --
 * and demands it persist across two consecutive checks, so an ordinary idle
 * gap between transfers is never mistaken for a stall.  The poll only runs
 * while something is outstanding, and forge_qmu_rxstall_budget caps the
 * rescues for the life of the boot, because an unbounded re-arm loop is how
 * the previous attempt went wrong.
 *
 * FALSIFICATION, stated before the run: if transfers still fail while
 * RXPOLL-REARM lines appear in dmesg, then the lost completion is not the
 * whole story and the re-armed descriptors are being lost the same way.
 * Rollback: `echo 0 > /sys/module/musb_hdrc/parameters/forge_qmu_rxstall`
 * (0644, live), or reflash boot-m681-rec2-20260821.img.
